## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong blue (#29ABE2) to communicate trust, stability, and connection to technology.
- Background color: Light, desaturated blue (#E5F6FD), visibly close in hue to the primary, but creating an airy, bright, spacious feel.
- Accent color: Muted violet (#8E24AA), which offers good contrast to the primary while aligning to the tech theme.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to provide a clean and modern feel.
- Use minimalist icons related to cloud storage and game assets to represent data handling processes.
- Employ a clear, intuitive layout with distinct sections for fetching, uploading, and link displaying to streamline the user experience.
- Incorporate subtle animations, such as progress bars during data fetching and upload sequences, to provide visual feedback to the user.
